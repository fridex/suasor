# Suasor

Suasor [latin: recommender] is a playground for me for different recommender systems. The first one is recommending Github repositories based on Github stars. Based on this blogpost: https://medium.com/towards-data-science/recommending-github-repositories-with-google-bigquery-and-the-implicit-library-e6cce666c77

Compute runs on OpenWhisk in BlueMix. Data is public Github data in BigQuery.
