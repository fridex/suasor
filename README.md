# Suasor

Suasor [latin: recommender] is a playground for building recommender systems in a serverless environment.

The first POC is based on the blogpost: [Recommending GitHub Repositories with Google BigQuery and the implicit library](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/recommending-github-repositories-with-google-bigquery-and-the-implicit-library-e6cce666c77).

* Data is public Github data in BigQuery.

## Deployment
